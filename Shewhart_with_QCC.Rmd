We're going to run the Shewhart algorithm using the QCC package on our data from 04 to 14th of July, 2022.
Shewhart because it's the easiest to begin & QCC because it doesn't use a real time metric so it's useful for our incomplete data with a "false" time metric (aggregating days but skipping the 21h-8h part). Also QCC is practical because of NA management : accepted (unless it's a whole day).
